            1. The theme for my website is a poker bar. So, my design is focused around a business. <br>
            2. All of my content is original, and I found images that were able to be used legally. <br>
            3. I have 5 separate pages. index.html is my home page, I then have events, a drink menu, <br>
            a how to play section, and a contact us page. <br>
            4/5. I have a red header on my website, and it contains all the navigation links to each page. <br>
            6. My site works on all the different screen layouts I've tried!<br>
            7. My site has a consistent dark style. Each page has its own style sheet and the shared sheet is <br>
            called shared-style.css.<br>
            8. I use several background images and the images on my pages have the alt attributes defined. <br>
            9. Each pages declares the poker palace favicon which I designed myself!! <br>
            10. All files are placed in the proper folders and are labelled correctly. <br>
            11. I did not use any libraries or frameworks! <br>
            12. All my html and css files compile with no warnings or errors<br>
            13. I used left alignment for a few of my items, but I did use center alignment as well. <br>
            14. My spacing is consistent and my text and boxes stay inside of their containing boxes. <br>
            15. I used Georgia, Barlow and Titillium Web as my three fonts. <br>
            16. My contact us page is a form, and it "submits" when you click the submit button. <br>
            17. My site links to a YouTube video as well as the WSOP website. <br>
            18. My code is readable and has clean formatting as well as kebab case for all class names. <br>
            19. On my how to play page, I have a rotating poker chip as my animation. <br>
            20. My git repository is shared with you! <br>
            21. All file names are lowercase and use only alphanumeric characters. <br>
